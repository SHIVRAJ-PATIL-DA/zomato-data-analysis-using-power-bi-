This repository showcases an in-depth Zomato data analysis project where I leveraged tools like Power BI and Tableau to explore key insights into the restaurant industry. The project covers various aspects of restaurant data, such as location, ratings, pricing, and consumer preferences. Through multiple visualizations, I provide a comprehensive view of how restaurants are distributed by factors like rating, price, location, and trends.

Key Visualizations:
Count of Restaurants by Year/Quarter/Month: Understand the growth patterns of restaurants over time.
Count of Restaurants by City and Country (Map View): See the distribution of restaurants across cities and countries.
Count of Restaurants by Price Bucket: Visualize how restaurants are distributed in terms of pricing (Budget, Mid-range, Premium).
Count of Restaurants by Rating (Line Chart): See how restaurant ratings correlate with restaurant numbers.
Availability of Online Orders vs Table Booking (Pie Chart): Understand the proportion of restaurants offering digital ordering vs. traditional table booking services.
Count of Restaurants and Average Rating (Column and Line Chart Combination): Compare the number of restaurants and their average ratings over time or by categories.
Tools Used:
